## Objective

My goal is to design and implement a vehicle detection sensor for the purpose of automating the activation and deactivation of Halloween and Christmas lights near my house. This project's scope, however, will be limited to the development of a sensor prototype that can detect vehicles passing on the designated lane where the sensor is installed, while disregarding vehicles on adjacent lanes.

## The Prototype

The prototype (refer to the figure below) comprises the [NUCLEO-F072RB][2] and [MMC5603NJ-B][3] development boards. The latter integrates the [MMC5603NJ][4] sensor, a 3-axis Anisotropic Magneto-Resistive (AMR) sensor featuring an integrated signal processing circuit and a digital communication interface (I2C). With a measurement range of +/-30 Gauss (G), a 0.0625mG resolution, and a 2mG total RMS noise level, this sensor accurately measures magnetic field strength. Capable of detecting both the Earth's magnetic field and disruptions caused by passing vehicles, which contain substantial amount of ferrous materials, it plays a crucial role in the prototype's functionality.

## The MMC5603NJ Driver

The "mmc5603nj" .c and .h files contain the implementation of the sensor's driver. This driver facilitates the reading and writing of one or more registers to/from the sensor (internal functions) while also providing external functions for sensor initialization and magnetic field measurements. The automatic set/reset functionality is activated to improve measurement accuracy. Notably, the driver omits certain features, aligning with the prototype's proof-of-concept nature rather than a long-term solution requiring such capabilities:

- Configuration customization for specific applications.
- Magnetic field offset calibration in response to temperature variations.
- Sensor reset functionality.

## The Application

The application designed for the NUCLEO board performs the following tasks:

- Acquires magnetic field vector components from the sensor, using them to compute the magnitude of the magnetic field.
- Identifies deviations in magnitude from a standard value, which allows inferring that there is a vehicle in close proximity to the sensor.
- Communicates this information to the user through a serial terminal (UART) and an LED.

The "main.c" file contains the application code, which is built upon the standard initialization and HAL code generated by the STM32 Cube MX software. The application uses a state machine, initializing the sensor, executing measurements, and detecting the presence of a nearby vehicle, as detailed in the "app" function. The I2C and UART interfaces, which facilitate communication with the sensor and data transmission over the serial interface respectively, operate in a blocking mode. This streamlined the application's architecture, maintaining an approximately 70 Hz sensor data rate — sufficient for detecting vehicles on the road near my house with a 35 mph speed limit. The output on the serial terminal includes the system tick, the raw and filtered magnetic field magnitudes squared, and the vehicle detection algorithm result (false or true).

## Vehicle Detection Algorithm

The raw data for magnetic field magnitude served as the basis for analyzing how passing vehicles affected sensor readings. The illustration below demonstrates distinct spikes in magnetic field magnitude, aligning with the passage of six vehicles near the prototype. This insight was pivotal in developing the detection algorithm, which involves deriving the magnetic field's average value and identifying deviations in data that surpass or fall below a predefined threshold. For the actual implementation of this algorithm, refer to the "detect_vehicle" function within the "main.c" file.

## Moving Median

A moving median filter was applied to smooth sensor data, establishing a baseline for comparison against the threshold. To optimize computation, squared magnitude values were utilized for threshold comparison, eliminating the need for square root operations. This threshold was set at 12000 mG^2.

When the squared magnitude surpasses or falls below the average value, updates to the average value are paused until the squared magnitude has returned within the threshold. This approach aims to accurately identify triggering events, considering the unknown duration of these events.

## Detection Issues

Slower fluctuations in data can lead to undetected triggering events, as observed around the 136-second mark in the figure below, where a vehicle wasn't detected by the algorithm. Contrastingly, at around the 207-second mark, with a quicker rise time, the algorithm successfully detected the vehicle. Employing the decimation technique may offer a solution to ensure accurate vehicle detection.

The same vehicle can be detected twice due to the nature of sensor data as can be seen around the 207-second mark. This issue can be resolved by introducing a deactivation delay. This delay could be calculated considering the average speed of vehicles on the specific road section where the sensor will be deployed, as well as a reasonable minimum distance between two vehicles.
